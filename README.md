# React TimeTravel Hooks

React countdown hooks being developed by using the awesome library [mckamey/countdownjs](https://github.com/mckamey/countdownjs)

## You will be able to

* use countdown with less and easier configuration
* get the remaining time in real-time by just giving the end date

## Progress

This project is currently in the progress of development. However, you can clone and use the hooks freely.
You can follow the process by the following checklist:

- [x] General structure
- [ ] Unit tests
- [ ] Ensure SOLID principles
- [ ] Refactor the file and project structure to be only a hooks library
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Publish to NPM

When all of the above steps are completed, a package will be released to npm.
